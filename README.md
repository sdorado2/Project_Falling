# Project_Falling
## Falling Blocks
A 2-D game where a player attempts to collect falling blocks. The winner is determined by the player that collects the most blocks.

## Controllers
Player One : 
> Left arrow and Right arrow

Player Two : 
> A and D keys


## Motivation
I wanted to challenge myself and was looking to create a game. The idea was to re-create a game I played when I was a child.

A couple of games inspired the game. The first was a minigame in Pokemon Stadium 2 called "egg emergency." The other game was "Egg" from the Game and Watch Gallery 3.
